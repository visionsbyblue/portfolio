          <p>​​​​​​​ As a creative assignment, I was to design the user interface of an online shop selling tickets for an event. I had a timeframe of 2 to 4 hours, in order to come up with the shop and cart views of the store. I started off by doing some google searches and viewed different types of online stores that I found creative. After 10 minutes of surfing, I already had some visions and concrete ideas taking shape in my mind. I opened Pinterest and started creating a mood board with layouts, images and typography that represented my thought flow. Finally, I opened my sketchbook and drew a few quick sketches.<br><br>After ideating, I opened up Sketch and started a new project. I hadn’t worked much with the program, so in addition to learning more about UI design, I took this assignment as a challenge to familiarize myself better with Sketch. <br><br> </p><br><br><br>

          <br><br><br>
          <p>In addition to wanting to create something visually pleasing and creative, I also wanted the UI to be intuitive and informative. I tried my best to only include elements that are necessary and have a function. I used three different fonts and five colors to create the two views (shop and cart). I used Illustrator to create the ”tickets” shown in the shop view, and uploaded the banner image from Unsplash. All other elements were found within Sketch and its libraries.<br><br> 

          I really enjoyed doing this assignment, and feel that I managed pretty well in bringing to life the ideas that I had in my mind – in just 3 hours. Of course, these views are the results of my own quick  creative thinking and if I were to design a UI for actual use, I would include users and tests into the process.  However, I think this project works as a good means of showcasing my creative skills and ways of working.<br><br>

          <p>As retrospective I realized that the UI would be even better, if I’d add a number next to the shopping cart indicating how many items are inside, the turquoise color in the navigation bar could be darker to have more contrast  with the background and lastly, I’d love to change the button design since I now know that that’s actually possible (I couldn’t find this feature when using Sketch for the first time). Otherwise, I’m pretty satisfied what I came up with in those 3 hours.</p><br><br><br>
