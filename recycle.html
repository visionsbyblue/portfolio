          <p>During my exchange semester in Monterrey, I took a course about creativity and innovation. One assignment in this course, was to figure out, how to better engage students in recycling. Even though it was a successful private university, the amount of trash and unrecycled disposable cutlery was very worrying.<br><br>We worked in teams of three people and the aim was to come up with a concept idea to address the problem. We interviewed students and teachers at the campus, and came up with a gamification concept, in order to activate the whole community studying and working at Tec de Monterrey. Our idea was to engage the campus cafeterias and stores, as well as the school board to recognize the individuals who are taking care of the environment. By taking some items or trash to a campus recycling center, a person would gain points and earn discount coupons. In the end of the year, the individuals with most points would obtain a spot on an organized weekend trip.<br><br>
          In addition to participating in ideation, user research and concept creation, I was in charge of creating marketing materials for our campaign. I created posters in InDesign, to explain the aim and the rules of the game.</p><br><br><br>
