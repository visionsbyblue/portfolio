          <p>​​​​​​​As a school assignment, we were to implement a service design project in multidisciplinary teams of 7 people. Our team was given a very interesting case study and got to work together with an actual client company. The goal was to design a tool or service that helps the gardening company to stay better in touch with its customers and their needs.<br><br>

          This project was part of a 10-credit course that lasted for 2,5 months. Our design process was divided into 3-week sprints, during which we had different tasks and project areas to focus on. In the beginning we did research on the field, contacted various stakeholders and defined user segments. After research, we jumped into the ideation phase and came up with initial ideas. Together with the client company, we chose one concept idea that was best linked to our research results. During the next sprints, we focused on building a wireframe model and a pilot prototype of our service. We conducted user tests and interviews with potential users, by showing them our first prototype and storyboards linked to its use. Finally, we had new knowledge upon which we could create a second iteration of our proto, and also started thinking about revenue models and future steps for our service.<br><br>

          In the end, we had a tested concept idea, that consisted of a physical service and a prototype of the digital application that would support the use of this service. The client company was very satisfied about our work, and even piloted our concept idea during the next summer. <br><br>

          <p>Personally, I really enjoyed working in this cross-disciplinary team, where everyone had their own expertise area and responsibilities to fulfill. Our team consisted of three UX designers, two coders and two business-oriented talents. I got to put my UX skills to the use, and worked hard during the prototyping and user research phase. I worked on the first wireframe model, ran user tests, conducted semi-structured interviews with users and hosted/facilitated a focus group workshop in our client's premises, together with other members of our team. Also, I found it really interesting and motivating to work with a client company and to co-create something for their use. In the end, I feel like I gained a lot of knowledge regarding the field of UX and service design.
