          <p>A few years back, my acquaintance became an entrepreneur by founding her own catering company. After a while she also became interested in importing French organic cosmetics to Finland. When she expanded her business in 2015, she realized she needed a website in order to reach out to her customers, and to better promote her services. At this point, she contacted me and asked for help in putting up her online store. I was happy to help, since I only had worked on university projects before this offer, and finally got the chance to try something new, completely on my own.<br><br>

        Creating this website was my first out-of-school project, and I had to learn a lot of new things from the scratch (e.g. setting up a domain, how to communicate with a customer, how to deal with dead-ends, etc.). I had pretty much free hands regarding the layout and appearance of the website, as well as the technical implementation of the site. However, the customer was responsible for the content production (texts, images, blogposts). I ended up creating the website with WordPress and used WP compatible WooCommerce to create the online store for her cosmetic products.<br><br>

        As a project, this was a very rewarding and educational one. I feel like I learned a lot about websoftware development thanks to this job, and really got to put myself and my skills to the test.</p><br><br><br>
