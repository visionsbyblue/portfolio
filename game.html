          <p>In 2016, I was doing my minor studies in computer science. I attended a course about Web Software Development, and as a final project we had to develop an online gamestore in groups of 3 people. We had 6 weeks to implement the project from scratch and were to use Django as the main programming language. We also chose to use Git for version control.<br><br>
          I was primarily responsible for the front-end of our project, and structured our HTML and CSS files. Our idea was to create a playful design, suitable for the gaming world. In addition to playful visuals, our aim was to pay special attention to the responsiveness of the site.<br><br>
          This project was very laborious, but rewarding. Django was a new programming language for all of our group members, so we spent a lot of time just to learn how to use it. Towards the end, the project progressed more smoothly, when each of us was working with topics and languages that were more familiar to ourselves. Thanks to its challenging nature, I gained a lot of new skills from taking part in this project.</p><br><br><br>
