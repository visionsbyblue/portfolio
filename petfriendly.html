          <p>​​​​​​​While studying in Monterrey, Mexico, I attended a class on ethnographic research and as a final assignment, we had to conduct a research in teams of 4. The aim was to discover user segments within a chosen subject area and to create a service that solves the pain points of our user group. My team researched how it is like to own a pet in Monterrey, an industrial city with not that many parks and recreational areas. We observed and conducted semi-structured interviews with pet owners, and discovered some common pain points and aspirations. Several interviewees pointed out that they would like to bring their pets along with them more often, since they don't like leaving them home alone. Some wished there to exist more pet friendly services (cafes, restaurants, stores, etc.) in Monterrey, while others didn't even know that a handful of such places already exists. With the help of our findings we designed an app, that lists all the hidden pet friendly places and services located in the city. <br><br>

          In addition to helping out in the user research, I was in charge of designing the UI of our application. We aimed for a playful but intuitive appearance, which I think was obtained well with this cheerful layout. However, the landing pages of the individual services and the favorites -page would need more refinement, in order to create a more unified and harmonious look. I would also rethink the tones of color, since they might be lacking of contrast. To take the project further, the UI should be tested with users in several takes, to come up with the best possible outcome.</p><br><br><br>
